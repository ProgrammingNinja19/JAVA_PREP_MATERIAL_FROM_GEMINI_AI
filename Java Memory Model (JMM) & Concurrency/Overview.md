The Java Memory Model (JMM) and Concurrency are vast and interconnected topics essential for writing correct and performant multi-threaded Java applications.

Here is a detailed, topic-wise breakdown suitable for comprehensive study:

## I. Java Memory Model (JMM) Fundamentals

The JMM is the formal specification defining how threads interact through memory, particularly concerning **visibility** and **ordering** of operations on shared variables.

### 1. Core Concepts
* **Need for JMM:** Addresses complexities arising from CPU caches, instruction reordering by the compiler/CPU, and multiple processors.
* **Shared vs. Local Memory:**
    * **Main Memory (Heap):** Shared by all threads (stores objects, instance fields, static fields, array elements).
    * **Working Memory (Thread Stack/Cache/Registers):** Private to each thread (stores local variables, method call frames, copies of shared variables).
* **Visibility:** Guaranteeing that a write to a shared variable by one thread is seen by a subsequent read of that variable by another thread.
* **Ordering:** Guaranteeing that one thread observes the operations of other threads in a predictable order, despite compiler/hardware reordering.
* **Atomicity:** Operations that are indivisible. JMM guarantees atomicity for reads/writes of most primitive types (except `long` and `double` which require `volatile` or synchronization to be guaranteed atomic).

### 2. The `Happens-Before` Relationship
The cornerstone of the JMM, it defines a partial ordering of memory operations to guarantee visibility and ordering. If Action A *happens-before* Action B, then the effects of A are visible to B.
* **Program Order Rule:** Actions within a single thread happen-before each other in program order.
* **Monitor Lock Rule:** An `unlock` on a monitor happens-before every subsequent `lock` on that same monitor. (Synchronization)
* **Volatile Variable Rule:** A `write` to a `volatile` variable happens-before every subsequent `read` of that variable.
* **Thread Start Rule:** A call to `Thread.start()` happens-before any action of the started thread.
* **Thread Join Rule:** All actions of a thread happen-before a successful return from `Thread.join()` in another thread.
* **Thread Interruption Rule:** A call to `t.interrupt()` happens-before the interrupted thread detects the interruption (either by catching `InterruptedException` or calling `isInterrupted()`).
* **Transitivity:** If A happens-before B, and B happens-before C, then A happens-before C.

### 3. Key JMM Mechanisms
* **`synchronized` keyword (Intrinsic Locks/Monitors):**
    * **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one thread can execute a synchronized method/block on a given object at a time.
    * **Visibility/Ordering:** An **unlock** flushes the thread's cache to main memory (makes writes visible). A subsequent **lock** invalidates the acquiring thread's local cache (forces reads from main memory).
* **`volatile` keyword:**
    * **Visibility:** Guarantees that every read of a volatile variable will see the most recent write to that variable.
    * **Ordering:** Prevents instruction reordering around the volatile variable accesses (acts as a form of memory fence/barrier).
    * **Limitation:** Does not guarantee atomicity for compound operations (e.g., `count++`).
* **`final` keyword (Initialization Safety):** Guarantees that a correctly constructed object's `final` fields are visible to other threads without additional synchronization, provided the object reference is not published prematurely.

## II. Java Concurrency Essentials

These are the practical tools and concepts built upon the foundation of the JMM.

### 1. Threads and Synchronization Basics
* **Creating Threads:** Extending `Thread` vs. Implementing `Runnable` (preferred).
* **Thread States:** New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, Terminated.
* **Race Conditions and Critical Sections:** Identifying shared mutable state and the code that accesses it.
* **Thread Safety:** Designing classes to be safe for concurrent use (encapsulation, immutability, synchronization).
* **Intrinsic Wait/Notify/NotifyAll:**
    * The `Object` methods: `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`.
    * Must be called inside a synchronized block/method (on the lock object).
    * Used for inter-thread communication (signaling).
* **Daemon Threads:** Background threads that do not prevent the JVM from exiting.

### 2. High-Level Concurrency Utilities (`java.util.concurrent`)

#### A. Explicit Locks (The `Lock` interface)
* **`ReentrantLock`:** A more flexible, explicit alternative to `synchronized`.
    * `lock()`, `unlock()`, `tryLock()`.
    * **Fairness:** Can be configured as a fair lock.
* **`ReadWriteLock` (e.g., `ReentrantReadWriteLock`):** Allows multiple readers or a single writer. Improves performance for read-heavy data structures.
* **`Condition` interface:** Allows for a more structured `wait`/`notify` mechanism, tied to an explicit `Lock`.

#### B. Atomic Variables (`java.util.concurrent.atomic`)
* **Purpose:** Provides atomic operations on single variables without using explicit locks.
* **Core Classes:** `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicReference`, etc.
* **CAS (Compare-and-Swap):** The underlying, lock-free algorithm used by atomic classes.

#### C. Executors and Thread Pools
* **`Executor` and `ExecutorService` interfaces:** Decoupling task submission from execution.
* **`Executors` factory class:** Creating standard thread pools:
    * `newFixedThreadPool()`, `newCachedThreadPool()`, `newSingleThreadExecutor()`, `newScheduledThreadPool()`.
* **`ThreadPoolExecutor`:** The core implementation class for custom thread pool configuration (core size, max size, keep-alive time, queue type).
* **Tasks:** `Runnable` (no return value) and `Callable` (returns a value, throws an exception).
* **`Future` and `CompletableFuture`:** Representing the result of an asynchronous computation.
* **`ForkJoinPool` and `ForkJoinTask`:** Framework for parallel computation by splitting tasks (forking) and combining results (joining).

#### D. Concurrent Collections
* **Motivation:** Collections that are thread-safe and offer better scalability than synchronized wrappers (e.g., `Collections.synchronizedList()`).
* **Key Classes:**
    * `ConcurrentHashMap` (highly scalable alternative to `Hashtable` or `Collections.synchronizedMap`).
    * `CopyOnWriteArrayList` (thread-safe for list traversal/reading, but expensive for writes).
* **Blocking Queues (`java.util.concurrent.blocking`):** Used extensively in Producer-Consumer patterns.
    * `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `PriorityBlockingQueue`.

#### E. Synchronizers
* **`Semaphore`:** Controls the number of threads that can access a resource concurrently.
* **`CountDownLatch`:** A thread waits until a set of other threads completes an operation.
* **`CyclicBarrier`:** A set of threads wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
* **`Exchanger`:** Two threads exchange data at a synchronization point.

### 3. Concurrency Problems
* **Deadlock:** A condition where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a permanent stall.
    * *Conditions for Deadlock:* Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No Preemption, Circular Wait.
    * *Prevention/Detection.*
* **Starvation:** A thread is perpetually denied access to a resource it needs (e.g., low-priority thread).
* **Livelock:** Threads are active but are constantly changing state in a way that prevents them from making progress (e.g., repeatedly yielding to each other).
* **Memory Consistency Errors:** When a thread sees stale data due to lack of visibility guarantees (the primary problem the JMM solves).

### 4. Advanced/Modern Concurrency
* **Virtual Threads (Project Loom/JDK 21+):** Lightweight, user-mode threads managed by the JVM, dramatically simplifying and improving the performance of I/O-bound concurrent applications.
    * Differences from Platform Threads.
    * `Thread.ofVirtual()`, `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`.
* **Immutability:** Creating immutable objects as a primary strategy for thread safety.
