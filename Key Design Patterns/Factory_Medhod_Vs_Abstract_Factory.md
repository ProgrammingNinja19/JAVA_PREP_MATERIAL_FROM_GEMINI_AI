The **Factory Method** and **Abstract Factory** are two of the most common creational design patterns, and they are often confused because both are used to abstract object creation. However, they solve problems at different scopes and use different structural mechanisms.

Here is a detailed explanation of their differences and when to use each one.

## Key Differences

The most critical distinction can be summarized in three points:

| Aspect | Factory Method | Abstract Factory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Create a **single product** while deferring the decision of **which concrete product to instantiate** to subclasses. | Create an entire **family of related or dependent products** without specifying their concrete classes. |
| **Structure/Mechanism** | Uses **Inheritance** (Subclassing) to change the product being created. | Uses **Composition** (Delegation) to change the family of products being created. |
| **Scope** | A **method** within a class (The "Creator"). | An **object** that is a "factory of factories." |

***

## 1. Factory Method Pattern

### Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Structure

In the Factory Method pattern, the "creator" class has a method (the factory method) that creates a product. Subclasses of the creator override this method to change the type of product that is created.

* **Product:** The interface for the object being created.
* **Concrete Product:** The actual object implementation.
* **Creator:** The abstract class or interface that contains the abstract `factoryMethod()`. It also contains business logic that uses the product.
* **Concrete Creator:** Subclasses that implement the `factoryMethod()` to return a specific `ConcreteProduct`.

### When to Use Factory Method

Use the Factory Method pattern when:

1.  **A class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.** The calling code (client) only needs to know about the product interface, and the concrete product is determined by the specific `Concrete Creator` used.
2.  **A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.** This allows for easy extensibility by creating new subclasses without modifying the base class.
3.  **You want to provide a hook for subclasses.** You have generic logic in the superclass, and you want to allow subclasses to "plug in" their specific product implementation.

**Example Use Case:** A **Logistics Company** needs to plan transport. The main `Logistics` class handles all the planning logic, but the transport method (Truck or Ship) depends on whether it's an on-road or on-sea delivery.
* The `Logistics` class has an abstract `createTransport()` method (the Factory Method).
* `RoadLogistics` subclass implements it to return a `Truck`.
* `SeaLogistics` subclass implements it to return a `Ship`.

## 2. Abstract Factory Pattern

### Intent
Provide an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

### Structure

The Abstract Factory is an interface with multiple creation methods (often a Factory Method for each product type). Each concrete factory implements all these methods to produce a set of consistent, related products.

* **Abstract Product A, B, etc.:** Interfaces for each type of product in the family (e.g., `Button`, `Checkbox`).
* **Concrete Product A1, B1, A2, B2, etc.:** Product implementations grouped by family (e.g., `WinButton`, `MacButton`).
* **Abstract Factory:** The interface with a creation method for *each* abstract product (`createButton()`, `createCheckbox()`).
* **Concrete Factory:** A class that implements the Abstract Factory and produces an entire, consistent family of concrete products (e.g., `WinFactory` creates *only* `WinButton` and `WinCheckbox`).

### When to Use Abstract Factory

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:

1.  **Your system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.** The client only deals with interfaces, not implementations.
2.  **You need to enforce consistency among related products.** You ensure that the client is only using products from one specific family (e.g., all "Mac" elements, or all "Dark Theme" elements).
3.  **You want to allow the system to be configured with one of several families of products.** You can switch the entire theme or platform at runtime by simply injecting a different concrete factory object into the client.

**Example Use Case:** A **Cross-Platform GUI Toolkit** needs to render different OS-specific components.
* The system needs **related products**: a `Button` and a `Checkbox`.
* The system needs **families of products**: the `Windows` family and the `Mac` family.
* An `Abstract Factory` (`GUIFactory`) has methods `createButton()` and `createCheckbox()`.
* A `MacFactory` (Concrete Factory) is responsible for ensuring *both* the Button and Checkbox are Mac-style.
* A `WinFactory` (Concrete Factory) is responsible for ensuring *both* the Button and Checkbox are Windows-style.

## Analogy: Ordering Food

| Aspect | Factory Method | Abstract Factory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **You Are** | The **Creator** class with generic logic. | The **Client** class that needs products. |
| **Your Task** | Make an Italian dish. | Get a full meal. |
| **Product Scope** | **One Product:** A **Pizza**. | **Family of Products:** **Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert.** |
| **The "Factory"** | Your **Subclass** (e.g., `ChicagoStyleRestaurant`). You override the `makePizza()` method. | The **Factory Object** you are handed (e.g., `VeganMenuFactory` or `GlutenFreeMenuFactory`). |
| **The Result** | You get *one* product (`DeepDishPizza` vs. `ThinCrustPizza`), with the choice decided by your class's *inheritance*. | You get an entire *consistent set* of products (`VeganSoup`, `VeganBurger`, `VeganCake`), with the choice decided by the *object* you use. |
