That's an excellent request. Focusing on a detailed breakdown for Core Fundamentals and Advanced Java is crucial for an SDE-3 role, as it moves beyond knowing "what" a feature is to understanding "why" and "how" it works under the hood.

Here is a detailed, topic-wise breakdown for the **Core Fundamentals & Advanced Java** section of your SDE-3 interview preparation:

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`volatile` Keyword** | **JMM & Visibility:** Understanding exactly what `volatile` guarantees (visibility, ordering) and what it does *not* guarantee (atomicity). **Happens-Before Relationship.** | "Explain the Happens-Before relationship with respect to `volatile` and `synchronized`." <br> "Can a `volatile` variable be used as a simple counter? Why or why not?" |
| **`synchronized`** | **Locks & Monitors:** Intrinsic locks, lock contention, and the difference between a synchronized block and a synchronized method. | "How is lock contention handled in Java? What are the performance implications of having a large synchronized block?" |
| **`java.util.concurrent` (JUC)** | **High-Performance Constructs:** `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`, `ReentrantLock` vs. `synchronized`, `ReadWriteLock`. **Atomic Classes.** | "When would you choose `ReentrantLock` over `synchronized`? What is the advantage of using a `tryLock()`?" <br> "Design a connection pool using a `Semaphore`." |
| **Concurrent Collections** | **Internal Working & Trade-offs:** Deep understanding of `ConcurrentHashMap` (e.g., how it differs from `HashTable` and older Java versions), `CopyOnWriteArrayList`. | "Explain the segment-based locking/non-blocking approach in `ConcurrentHashMap`." <br> "When is `CopyOnWriteArrayList` a good choice, and what is its major drawback?" |
| **Executors & Futures** | **Thread Pool Management:** `ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor` parameters (core/max size, keep-alive, queue type), `Future`, and **`CompletableFuture`**. | "You are designing a high-throughput microservice. How do you configure a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to minimize latency and maximize utilization?" <br> "Implement an asynchronous service call using `CompletableFuture` with a timeout and fallback logic." |

### 3\. Collections Framework & Data Structures

| Sub-Topic | SDE-3 Focus (Depth of Knowledge) | Key Practice Questions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`HashMap` Internals** | **Collision Handling:** Explain chaining vs. open addressing. **Resizing:** When and how resizing occurs. **Performance Analysis:** Explain average vs. worst-case complexity ($O(1)$ vs. $O(n)$) and its relation to the load factor. | "Walk through the `put()` method in `HashMap` when a collision occurs, then when a resizing occurs." <br> "What is treeification in Java 8 `HashMap`?" |
| **Set & List Implementations** | **Trade-offs:** Detailed comparison of performance for `ArrayList` vs. `LinkedList` (access vs. insertion). `HashSet` vs. `TreeSet`. | "Design a log-processing pipeline. When would you use a `PriorityQueue` over a simple `Queue`?" |
| **Iterators** | **Fail-Fast vs. Fail-Safe:** Understanding how different collections handle concurrent modifications. | "What is a `ConcurrentModificationException`, and why does it occur?" <br> "Compare the iterators of `ArrayList` (fail-fast) and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` (fail-safe)." |

### 4\. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Performance Tuning

| Sub-Topic | SDE-3 Focus (Depth of Knowledge) | Key Practice Questions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Garbage Collection (GC)** | **Generational GC:** Young, Old, and Permanent Generations (Metaspace). **Algorithms:** Mark and Sweep, Stop-The-World (STW). **Major Collectors:** Detailed comparison of **G1, Parallel, and ZGC/Shenandoah**â€”their goals, latency characteristics, and when to choose each. | "Your service is experiencing high-latency spikes (pauses). How would you use GC logs to diagnose the issue, and what collector would you switch to?" |
| **Memory Areas** | **Stack vs. Heap vs. Metaspace:** Where different data types reside and how they are managed. **`OutOfMemoryError`:** Root causes and prevention strategies for common errors (Heap vs. Metaspace/PermGen). | "Explain the lifecycle of an object from allocation in the Young Generation to being collected." <br> "What are possible causes of an `OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace` and how do you fix it?" |
